            SEO is not a one-time task. After your content ranks, track its performance and adjust as needed. 
            Google’s algorithm changes often, and what worked a year ago might not be effective today. 
            Use analytics tools to track your content’s performance. Be ready to optimize it as needed.

            You wrote a blog post on “SEO strategies for 2024.” After a few months, your traffic starts to decline. 
            By reviewing your analytics, you may find that users aren’t spending enough time on the page. 
            This may mean your content needs more depth. Or, your Meta descriptions need tweaks to attract 
            more relevant clicks.
